# Rover Agenda - The #1 App for EAHS Students

## Addressing the prompt
This year's prompt for the FBLA Mobile Application Development event was to create an app that would
allow students to manage their school activities using a variety of features, including:
- A schedule
- A lunch menu
- A teachers list
- An extracurriculars page
- A calendar
- A bug reporting system

That's what our app, Rover Agenda, is here for. This app brings all of your school concerns into
one easy-to-access place. With a customizable schedule, a lunch menu, a list for emailing teachers,
a list of extracurriculars, a school event calendar, and a bug reporting system, you can keep track of
everything you need to know. Each part of the app is customized to your individual needs, with data
stored within your unique student account. No longer do you have to have several different apps to
keep track of everything; with Rover Agenda, you can be sure to keep track of everything in your busy
high school experience.

## Features
    - Custom Schedule
    - Weekly Lunch Menu
    - Teachers List
    - Built-in Email Form
    - Extracurricular Information
    - School Calendar

## Usage

Here's what you need to get your project running:
- Open the Solution in Visual Studio 2022
- Initialize the SQL Server Express LocalDB
  - In Visual Studio, go to `View > Other Windows > Package Manager Console`
  - In the console that appears at the bottom, type the command `Update-Database` and wait for the migration to finish.
- Run the project
  - Press `Control + F5` to run the project without the debugger, or `F5` to run the project with the debugger attached.
- Seed Data
  - When running the project for the first time, the database will be seeded with an admin user.
  - You can log in to this account with the username `admin` and the password `Password123!`. It is _highly_ recommended that you change this password after logging in for the first time.
